# CS230-Operating_Platforms
**Module 8 Journal Portfolio**


**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room is a successfull puzzle competition game launched on the Android platform with a focus to grow to a web-based version of the current app to expand the game to more consumers, making this available on multiple platforms across multiple devices.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I wrote extensively over operating system architecture, memory management, and the usage of virtual machines for cloud-based development. I made sure to apply my focus on the differences and similarties between the different operating architectures and provided cases for each as to why one may be better for certain applications versus the alternatives. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
Using a UML diagram helped me visualize exactly what the connections and parent to child heirarchies are, saving me time and brain energy. Developing strict classes with a clear picture of what instances are private versus public helped me prevent failed executions and bugs in the long run.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I could have provided a more in-depth analysis between the operating systems of Mac, Windows and Linux. For a web-based program/game such as this, web-browsers are the main variable for compatibility. In these instances, they each have different web-browsers depending if they have a third-party application installed, making it an important topic to understand when understanding compatiblity for not only developers, but consumers.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
Sometimes, meeting the user's needs allows some breathing room for other tasks which may not be up to standard quality. If the user is satisfied with the UI because their needs are met, they may overlook some other aspects of the program that may be otherwise catastrophic had the other points of important not been met. The consumer is the ultimate resource for information and meeting their demands only brings in profit.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
I think brainstorming and thinking over any idea then narrowing it down to probable vs possible helps eliminate and organize tasks in order of importance. Taking a client's requirements and breaking them down into order of importance and taking a technical approach in completing their request will help efficiently create a plan to create the code and architecture to provide a solution.
